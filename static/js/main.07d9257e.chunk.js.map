We were a five-person family living on one salary. We spent all of our discretionary cash and all of our vacation time putting everyone on a plane and going to see my parents in New Jersey and Karol’s parents in South Carolina.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing our parents was great; but hanging out in subdivisions in New Jersey and South Carolina was nobody’s idea of a vacation adventure. Then my Dad’s sister Marilyn offered to let us have our family get-togethers at her duplex in Isles of Capri, Florida. The duplex was modest, but had a dock that was a short boat ride from beautiful beaches on Florida’s Gulf Coast.</p>\n\n<p>Karol’s parents met us there. My parents met us there. Karol’s sister and her family met us there. Those were the very best times of our lives.</p>\n\n<p>So, for the past twenty-seven years, Karol and I have dreamed about doing for our family and friends what Aunt Marilyn did for Karol and me and our family. That is, have a place where friends and family can visit for a week, at no expense, enjoy the outdoors, hiking, horseback riding, swimming, etc. And spend time catching up.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of November, Karol and I moved from the San Francisco Bay Area to Loudon, TN. We’re renting a home right now. But we’ve purchased a 45-acre agricultural parcel. The parcel has a potential home site with a 180-degree view of the Tellico Reservoir. We’re planning to build a horse farm with a four-bedroom main house, a pool, a two-bedroom pool house, and a horse barn.</p>\n\n\n          \n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport {\n  BrowserRouter as Router,\n  Switch,\n  Route,\n  Link\n} from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nimport './App.css';\nimport Home from './components/Home';\nimport HousePlans from './components/HousePlans';\nimport Land from './components/Land';\nimport Motivation from './components/Motivation';\n\n// This site has 3 pages, all of which are rendered\n// dynamically in the browser (not server rendered).\n//\n// Although the page does not ever refresh, notice how\n// React Router keeps the URL up to date as you navigate\n// through the site.
